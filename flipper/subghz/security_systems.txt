# ============================================================================
#  ATTACK 1: SENSOR REPLAY (Door/Window Sensors)
# ============================================================================
#
#  Most door/window sensors transmit FIXED codes when opened/closed.
#  Capture the "door open" signal -> replay it to trigger/test alarm.
#
#  Steps:
#  1. Flipper -> Sub-GHz -> Read RAW on sensor frequency
#  2. Open/close a protected door/window
#  3. Capture the sensor transmission
#  4. Replay to trigger false alarms (distraction/nuisance)
#  5. Or: Study timing to understand when sensors report
#
# ============================================================================
#  ATTACK 2: JAMMING (Sensor Suppression)
# ============================================================================
#
#  Jam the sensor frequency to prevent the panel from receiving signals.
#  While jammed, sensors cannot report breaches.
#
#  CRITICAL: Flipper Zero's TX power is LOW (10dBm).
#  Effective jamming range: ~5-10 meters
#  Better option: Use ESP32 or HackRF for higher power jamming
#
#  Detection: Some panels detect jamming (RF supervision)
#    - 2GIG panels: Will report "RF jam" after ~30 seconds
#    - Honeywell panels: May report "sensor supervision loss"
#    - SimpliSafe Gen2: Has jam detection
#
# ============================================================================
#  ATTACK 3: REPLAY ARM/DISARM (SimpliSafe Gen1)
# ============================================================================
#
#  SimpliSafe Gen1 keypad sends UNENCRYPTED arm/disarm signals!
#  Research by Andrew Zonenberg (2016) demonstrated this.
#
#  Steps:
#  1. Capture a DISARM command from the keypad (433.920 MHz)
#  2. Replay to disarm the system at any time
#  3. PIN code is transmitted in plaintext
#
#  SimpliSafe Gen2 (2018+) fixed this with AES encryption.
#
# ============================================================================
#  ATTACK 4: SENSOR CLONING / SPOOFING
# ============================================================================
#
#  Clone a sensor's ID to become a "trusted" device on the panel.
#
#  Use case:
#  1. Capture sensor transmission
#  2. Extract sensor ID from the signal
#  3. Add sensor ID to Flipper Sub-GHz library
#  4. Send "sensor OK" signals to keep panel thinking door is closed
#     while actually opening it
#
# ============================================================================
#  HONEYWELL/2GIG/ADT DEEP DIVE (345 MHz)
# ============================================================================
#
#  The Honeywell 5800 series (345 MHz) is the MOST DEPLOYED wireless
#  security sensor in North America. Used by:
#    - ADT, Vivint, Brinks, Frontpoint, Cove, and dozens more
#
#  Protocol details:
#    - Frequency: 345.000 MHz
#    - Modulation: OOK
#    - Data rate: ~2kbps
#    - Message format: [Preamble][Serial#][Status][Loop#][Checksum]
#    - Serial: 20-bit (unique per sensor)
#    - Status: tamper, low battery, supervision
#    - NO ENCRYPTION. NO ROLLING CODE. NO AUTHENTICATION.
#
#  Flipper capture settings:
#    Frequency: 345000000
#    Preset: FuriHalSubGhzPresetOok650Async
#
#  What you can extract:
#    - Sensor serial number
#    - Sensor type (door, motion, glass break, smoke)
#    - Loop number (which zone)
#    - Battery status
#    - Tamper status
#
# ============================================================================
#  Z-WAVE SECURITY SYSTEMS (Ring, SmartThings)
# ============================================================================
#
#  Z-Wave operates at 908.42 MHz (US) / 868.42 MHz (EU)
#  Modern Z-Wave (S2) uses AES-128 encryption.
#
#  Flipper Zero CAN read Z-Wave frequency but CANNOT:
#    - Decode encrypted Z-Wave S2 messages
#    - Replay Z-Wave commands (unique nonces)
#
#  Flipper Zero CAN:
#    - Detect Z-Wave devices transmitting
#    - Record RAW signals for offline analysis
#    - Identify Z-Wave network presence (passive recon)
#
# ============================================================================
#  COUNTERMEASURES & DETECTION AVOIDANCE
# ============================================================================
#
#  1. RF Supervision: Panel checks sensor heartbeats (every 60-90 min)
#     Mitigation: Replay sensor heartbeat during attack window
#
#  2. Jam Detection: Panel monitors for continuous RF energy on its freq
#     Mitigation: Use short burst jamming, not continuous
#
#  3. Cross-zone Detection: Multiple sensors in same area
#     Mitigation: Suppress ALL sensors in the path simultaneously
#
#  4. Cellular Backup: Panel calls monitoring even if WiFi jammed
#     Mitigation: Cell jammer (VERY illegal) or cut power to panel
#
#  5. Battery Backup: Panel runs 24-72 hours on battery
#     Mitigation: Wait out the battery (impractical in most cases)
