#  SYSTEM-SPECIFIC ATTACK GUIDE
# ============================================================================
#
# === CHAMBERLAIN / LIFTMASTER / CRAFTSMAN (MyQ) ===
#  Protocol: Security+ 2.0 (rolling code)
#  Frequency: 310 MHz or 315 MHz
#  Attack: Rolljam (requires external jammer or timing)
#  Notes:
#    - Yellow "Learn" button = Security+ 1.0 (easier to attack)
#    - Purple "Learn" button = Security+ 2.0 (harder)
#    - MyQ WiFi doesn't change RF vulnerability
#    - Older models (pre-2011) may use fixed code at 390 MHz
#
# === GENIE (Overhead Door) ===
#  Protocol: Intellicode (rolling code, KeeLoq-based)
#  Frequency: 315 MHz or 390 MHz
#  Attack: Rolljam
#  Notes:
#    - Intellicode 1 = KeeLoq (well-documented weakness)
#    - Intellicode 2 = Enhanced KeeLoq
#    - Older "DIP switch" models (12-bit fixed): FULLY VULNERABLE
#      Capture once, replay forever
#
# === LINEAR / MULTI-CODE ===
#  Protocol: Linear Fixed Code (10-bit)
#  Frequency: 310 MHz or 318 MHz
#  Attack: Direct capture & replay, OR brute force (1024 combinations)
#  Notes:
#    - Only 10 DIP switches = 1024 possible codes
#    - At ~100ms per code, brute force takes ~2 minutes
#    - Flipper can iterate through all combinations
#    - MegaCode: Linear's rolling code upgrade (harder)
#
# === NICE / NICE FLOR-S ===
#  Protocol: Nice FLO (fixed) / Nice FloR-S (rolling)
#  Frequency: 433.920 MHz
#  Attack: FLO = capture & replay. FloR-S = rolljam.
#  Notes:
#    - FLO remotes have 12-bit fixed code — fully clonable
#    - FloR-S uses KeeLoq derivative
#    - SMILO remotes = Nice FLO compatible
#
# === CAME ===
#  Protocol: CAME Fixed (12-bit) / CAME TOP (rolling)
#  Frequency: 433.920 MHz
#  Attack: Fixed = capture & replay. TOP = rolljam.
#  Notes:
#    - 12-bit fixed code = 4096 combinations
#    - CAME TOP 432 uses rolling code
#    - CAME TWIN remotes use fixed code
#
# === MARANTEC ===
#  Protocol: Marantec (fixed 12-bit or rolling)
#  Frequency: 433.920 MHz or 868.300 MHz
#  Attack: Depends on model age
#  Notes:
#    - Models with DIP switches = fixed code
#    - Modern models use rolling code
#    - Frequency varies by market (EU: 868, others: 433)
#
# === HORMANN ===
#  Protocol: Hormann HSM (fixed) / BiSecur (rolling)
#  Frequency: 868.300 MHz
#  Attack: HSM = capture & replay. BiSecur = very difficult.
#  Notes:
#    - HSM2/HSM4 remotes: fixed code at 868.3 MHz
#    - BiSecur (blue button remotes): 128-bit rolling, very secure
#    - HSM remotes still widely deployed in Europe
#
# === FAAC ===
#  Protocol: FAAC SLH (rolling code)
#  Frequency: 868.350 MHz
#  Attack: Rolljam possible on older models
#  Notes:
#    - SLH = Self Learning Hopping code
#    - Older FAAC remotes may use fixed codes
#    - XT series uses stronger encryption
#
# === BFT ===
#  Protocol: BFT Mitto (rolling code)
#  Frequency: 433.920 MHz
#  Attack: Rolljam on older models, newer use KeeLoq variant
#  Notes:
#    - Mitto 2/4 are very common in Southern Europe
#    - D111xxx models are easier targets

#  BRUTE FORCE FEASIBILITY

#
#  CODE LENGTH | COMBINATIONS | TIME @ 100ms/code | FEASIBLE?
#  ------------|--------------|-------------------|----------
#  8-bit       | 256          | 26 seconds        | YES
#  10-bit      | 1,024        | 1.7 minutes       | YES
#  12-bit      | 4,096        | 6.8 minutes       | YES
#  16-bit      | 65,536       | 1.8 hours         | MAYBE
#  20-bit      | 1,048,576    | 29 hours          | NO (practical)
#  24-bit      | 16,777,216   | 19 days           | NO
#  Rolling     | N/A          | N/A               | Rolljam only
#
# ============================================================================
#  DIP SWITCH TO CODE MAPPING (Linear/Multi-Code)
# ============================================================================
#
#  DIP switches are numbered 1-10 (left to right).
#  Each switch has 3 positions: UP(+), DOWN(-), CENTER(0)
#
#  For Flipper Sub-GHz Add Manually:
#    Protocol: Linear
#    Frequency: 310000000 (310 MHz)
#    Data: Convert DIP positions to binary
#          + = 1, - = 0, Center = floating (try both)
#
#  Example: Switches ++--0++0--
#    Binary: 1100X1100X (X = test 0 and 1)
#    4 combinations to test (2 floating switches)
