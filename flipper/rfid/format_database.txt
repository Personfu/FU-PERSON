# ============================================================================
#  ATTACK 1: BADGE READ & CLONE
# ============================================================================
#
#  FASTEST ATTACK. Most badges have ZERO security.
#
#  Steps:
#  1. Flipper -> 125kHz RFID -> Read
#  2. Hold Flipper against target badge (< 3cm / 1.2in)
#  3. Flipper reads UID in < 1 second
#  4. Save the badge data
#  5. Emulate: Flipper becomes the badge
#  6. Write: Clone to blank T5577 card
#
#  RANGE TIPS:
#    - Direct contact: 100% read rate
#    - Through jeans pocket: Works at ~2cm
#    - Through wallet: Works at ~2-3cm
#    - Through backpack: Usually too far (5-10cm)
#    - Through jacket pocket: Works if badge against fabric

# ============================================================================
#  ATTACK 2: T5577 CLONING
# ============================================================================
#
#  T5577 is a PROGRAMMABLE 125kHz card that can emulate ANY protocol.
#
#  Steps:
#  1. Read original badge on Flipper
#  2. Insert blank T5577 card/fob
#  3. Flipper -> 125kHz RFID -> Saved -> Select badge
#  4. Choose "Write"
#  5. Hold T5577 against Flipper
#  6. T5577 now contains exact copy of original badge
#
#  T5577 CONFIGURATION BLOCKS:
#    Block 0: Configuration (modulation, bit rate, data blocks)
#    Block 1-7: Data blocks (UID and user data)
#
#  MODULATION CONFIGS:
#    EM4100:  Manchester encoding, RF/64 bit rate
#    HID:     FSK2a encoding, RF/50 bit rate
#    Indala:  PSK1 encoding, RF/32 bit rate

# ============================================================================
#  ATTACK 3: UID BRUTE FORCE
# ============================================================================
#
#  If you can't read a badge, try brute forcing the reader.
#
#  EM4100 has 40-bit UID = ~1 trillion combinations (too many)
#  BUT: Many systems only check part of the UID or use predictable ranges.
#
#  APPROACH:
#  1. Read one valid badge to get the facility/site code
#  2. Increment the card number portion
#  3. Emulate each and test against reader
#
#  Example (HID 26-bit):
#    Facility Code: 100 (known from reading one badge)
#    Card Numbers: 1-65535
#    Test rate: ~1 per 2 seconds (manual) or automated via GPIO
#
#  TIME ESTIMATES:
#    100 cards: ~3 minutes (manual)
#    1000 cards: ~30 minutes (manual)
#    65535 cards: ~36 hours (need automation)

# ============================================================================
#  ATTACK 4: DOWNGRADE ATTACK
# ============================================================================
#
#  Some modern readers support BOTH 125kHz and 13.56MHz.
#  If the 13.56MHz side is encrypted (iClass SE, DESFire),
#  try reading the 125kHz side instead — it may be unencrypted.
#
#  Steps:
#  1. Try 125kHz RFID Read first (always)
#  2. If badge responds on 125kHz, clone it
#  3. Test the clone on the reader
#  4. Many multi-format readers accept either frequency
#
#  COMMON DUAL-FORMAT SYSTEMS:
#    - HID iClass SE + HID Prox (125kHz side is vulnerable)
#    - MIFARE + EM4100 (EM4100 side has no encryption)

# ============================================================================
#  COMMON UID PATTERNS BY INDUSTRY
# ============================================================================
#
#  CORPORATE OFFICES:
#    Protocol: HID ProxCard II (26-bit)
#    Facility codes: 1-255 (assigned by installer)
#    Card numbers: Sequential from 1
#    Pattern: FC:001-255, CN:0001-9999
#
#  UNIVERSITIES:
#    Protocol: HID iClass or MIFARE
#    Often dual-format with 125kHz fallback
#    Student IDs may be printed on card = UID hint
#
#  HOTELS:
#    Protocol: Usually MIFARE Classic 1K (13.56MHz)
#    Room number often encoded in sector 1-2
#    Master keys: Sector 0 or 15
#
#  PARKING GARAGES:
#    Protocol: EM4100 or HID Prox
#    Sequential numbering from lot installer
#    Often same facility code for entire garage

# ============================================================================
#  SOCIAL ENGINEERING FOR BADGE ACCESS
# ============================================================================
#
#  ELEVATOR METHOD:
#    Stand behind badge holder in elevator
#    Flipper in pocket, reading through clothing
#    "What floor?" (keep them turned toward you)
#
#  DESK METHOD:
#    During meeting/conversation, badge on desk/lanyard
#    Hold Flipper under table near their badge
#    Or: "Can I see your badge? Comparing designs."
#
#  SMOKER'S AREA:
#    Badge holders often hang badges on belt/lanyard
#    Stand close while chatting, Flipper in pocket
#
#  TAILGATING + READ:
#    Follow someone through secure door
#    Read their badge as they use it
#    Now you have a clone for next time
