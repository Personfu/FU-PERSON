# ============================================================================
#  MOST COMMON: DS1990A (Family 01h) — ACCESS CONTROL
# ============================================================================
#
#  The DS1990A is the #1 iButton for physical access control.
#  It contains ONLY a 48-bit unique serial number (no memory, no crypto).
#
#  UID FORMAT: [Family Code(8)][Serial Number(48)][CRC(8)] = 8 bytes total
#  Example: 01:A2:B3:C4:D5:E6:00:CRC
#
#  SECURITY: ZERO. The serial number is broadcast in plaintext.
#  Read it once -> emulate forever.
#
#  Flipper Zero workflow:
#  1. iButton -> Read
#  2. Touch Flipper's iButton pad to the target key
#  3. Flipper reads the full 8-byte UID
#  4. Save -> Emulate (Flipper acts as the key)
#  5. Or Write to blank RW1990/TM1990 clone button

# ============================================================================
#  WRITABLE iBUTTON BLANKS
# ============================================================================
#
#  BLANK TYPE  | COMPATIBLE WITH | WRITE METHOD  | COST
#  ------------|-----------------|---------------|------
#  RW1990      | DS1990A (01h)   | Flipper Write | ~$1
#  TM1990      | DS1990A (01h)   | Flipper Write | ~$1
#  TM2004      | Multiple        | Flipper Write | ~$2
#  RW2004      | Multiple        | Special tool  | ~$3
#
#  RW1990 is the most common and cheapest clone button.
#  Available on Amazon/AliExpress in bulk (50 for ~$25).

# ============================================================================
#  iBUTTON ATTACK SCENARIOS
# ============================================================================
#
#  SCENARIO 1: APARTMENT INTERCOM
#    Most apartment buildings in Eastern Europe and Russia use
#    DS1990A iButtons for intercom/door access.
#    Read one resident's key -> clone -> access entire building.
#    Many intercoms accept ANY DS1990A key that's been registered.
#
#  SCENARIO 2: ELEVATOR ACCESS
#    Some buildings restrict elevator access using iButtons.
#    Clone a resident's key to access restricted floors.
#
#  SCENARIO 3: PARKING GATE
#    iButton readers at parking garage entrances.
#    Read the attendant's master key for unlimited access.
#
#  SCENARIO 4: LAUNDRY ROOM
#    Coin-op machines with iButton balance stored on DS1961S.
#    DS1961S uses SHA-1 which is harder to clone.
#    But some systems only check the UID (DS1990A mode).
#
#  SCENARIO 5: GYM / POOL ACCESS
#    Fitness facilities often use basic iButton readers.
#    DS1990A with no encryption = instant clone.

# ============================================================================
#  iBUTTON READ TECHNIQUES
# ============================================================================
#
#  The Flipper's iButton pad is on the BOTTOM of the device.
#  Two copper contacts must touch the iButton simultaneously.
#
#  CONTACT TIPS:
#  - Center of iButton must touch BOTH Flipper contacts
#  - Apply firm pressure for good electrical contact
#  - If read fails, rotate the iButton slightly and retry
#  - Clean both contacts with alcohol if dirty
#  - Read distance: ZERO (must make physical contact)
#
#  SOCIAL ENGINEERING:
#  - "Hey, my key stopped working. Can I try yours to test if
#     it's the reader or my key?" (read their key while "testing")
#  - Offer to "fix" someone's non-working key
#  - Maintenance worker disguise: "Testing all keys in the system"
