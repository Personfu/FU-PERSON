#  FLLC - Flipper Zero NFC/RFID Attack Playbook
# ============================================================================
#  Techniques for NFC and RFID testing with Flipper Zero.
#
#  SUPPORTED PROTOCOLS:
#    NFC-A (ISO 14443-3A) - Mifare Classic, Mifare Ultralight, NTAG
#    NFC-B (ISO 14443-3B) - Some passports, transit cards
#    NFC-V (ISO 15693)    - Some access cards
#    NFC-F (FeliCa)       - Sony FeliCa transit cards
#    EMV                  - Contactless payment cards (read only)
#
#  RFID 125kHz:
#    EM4100              - Very common access badges
#    HID Prox            - HID corporate badges
#    Indala              - Older access systems
#    FDX-B/A             - Animal chips, some access cards
# ============================================================================

# ============================================================================
#  ATTACK 1: BADGE CLONING (125kHz RFID)
# ============================================================================
#  Most corporate access badges use 125kHz RFID (EM4100 or HID Prox).
#  These have NO encryption and can be cloned in seconds.
#
#  Steps:
#  1. Flipper -> 125kHz RFID -> Read
#  2. Hold Flipper next to target badge (< 2cm distance)
#  3. Flipper reads and saves the badge UID
#  4. Flipper -> 125kHz RFID -> Saved -> Select badge
#  5. Choose "Emulate" to use Flipper as the badge
#  6. Or "Write" to clone onto a blank T5577 card
#
#  SOCIAL ENGINEERING:
#  - "Hey can I see your badge? I'm comparing designs between offices"
#  - Walk closely behind badge holder in elevator
#  - Place Flipper near badge on a desk/table while talking

# ============================================================================
#  ATTACK 2: MIFARE CLASSIC CRACKING (13.56MHz NFC)
# ============================================================================
#  Mifare Classic cards have known cryptographic weaknesses.
#  Flipper can attempt dictionary and nested attacks.
#
#  Steps:
#  1. Flipper -> NFC -> Read
#  2. Hold card to Flipper (< 1cm)
#  3. If Mifare Classic detected, Flipper starts key recovery
#  4. "Detect Reader" mode: Hold Flipper to a card reader to capture keys
#     the reader uses, then use those keys to read the card
#  5. Once keys recovered, full dump is saved
#  6. Can emulate or write to blank Mifare Classic card
#
#  TIP: Use "Detect Reader" on the actual door reader first.
#       It will reveal the authentication keys it uses.
#       Then use those keys to fully dump the real card.

# ============================================================================
#  ATTACK 3: EMV CARD READING (Contactless Payment)
# ============================================================================
#  Flipper can READ data from contactless credit/debit cards.
#  This captures: card number, expiry date, some transaction data.
#  It CANNOT clone payment cards (dynamic authentication).
#
#  Steps:
#  1. Flipper -> NFC -> Read
#  2. Hold wallet/card near Flipper
#  3. Captured data includes PAN, expiry, cardholder name
#  4. Data is saved for OSINT/reconnaissance purposes
#
#  LIMITATIONS:
#  - CVV/CVC is NOT on the chip
#  - Online transactions require CVV
#  - EMV has dynamic authentication (can't replay)
#  - Mostly useful for identifying card holder info

# ============================================================================
#  ATTACK 4: NTAG/ULTRALIGHT MANIPULATION
# ============================================================================
#  NTAG213/215/216 are writable NFC tags often used for:
#  - Amiibo figures (NTAG215)
#  - Smart posters
#  - Tap-to-connect WiFi
#  - Business cards
#  - Some access control
#
#  Steps:
#  1. Read original tag
#  2. Save dump
#  3. Modify data (e.g., change URL in smart poster)
#  4. Write to blank NTAG
#  5. Replace original (social engineering NFC phishing)
#
#  EVIL NFC TAG:
#  - Write a malicious URL to a blank NTAG215
#  - Place near legitimate NFC reader/poster
#  - Victims tap and get redirected to phishing page

# ============================================================================
#  ATTACK 5: RFID FUZZING
# ============================================================================
#  Brute force RFID UIDs against access control readers.
#
#  Steps:
#  1. Flipper -> 125kHz RFID -> Extra Actions -> Read ASK/PSK RAW
#  2. Capture the reader's behavior
#  3. Use saved/emulated cards with sequential UIDs
#  4. Note which UIDs the reader responds to
#
#  This is slow but can sometimes find valid UIDs.

# ============================================================================
#  BEST PRACTICES
# ============================================================================
#  - Always attempt 125kHz read first (faster, more common)
#  - Then try NFC 13.56MHz
#  - Save EVERYTHING - even partial reads are useful
#  - "Detect Reader" mode is incredibly powerful for Mifare
#  - Keep a collection of captured badges organized by location
#  - Label saved files with date/location/context
#  - T5577 blank cards can emulate most 125kHz protocols
#  - Mifare Classic 1K blank cards for 13.56MHz cloning
